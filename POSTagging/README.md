Program generates a unigram of most probable tags of the words trained by the corpus. We can input the statement to check for POS tags and 
also calculate the error of the model by inputting the correct tags.

Assumptions: For the unseen words NN is tagged

1. The first line of the main def contains the corpus file path.
2. Run unigram.py using command py BiGrams.py
3. Enter the sentence for which tagging needs to be done
4. You wil see the tagging based on Unigrams
5. Enter the tagged sentence
6. Error rate and number of wrongly tagged words will be displayed.
7. Check for a generated text file unigrams.txt for most probable pos tags of words in corpus
8. Python 3 is required to run the program.
